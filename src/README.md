# Astra Grafana App

This Grafana plugin adds support for [Astra](https://github.com/slackhq/astra), and includes both a datasource and
simplified explore interface.

To get started [install](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/plugins/installation/) this app, then enable it from
the Grafana plugins page under "Astra by Slack". Once installed a new datasource type will be available, and the Astra
explore icon will appear on the left side of the Grafana UI.
