This Grafana plugin adds support for [Astra](https://github.com/slackhq/astra), and includes both a datasource and 
simplified explore interface.

To get started [install](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/plugins/installation/) this app, then enable it from 
the Grafana plugins page under "Astra by Slack". Once installed a new datasource type will be available, and Astra will
appear in the navigation under Apps.
